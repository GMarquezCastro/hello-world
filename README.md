# hello-world
You damn right is another repository

So...what can I say about myself?<br>
I'm just a guy looking to make a contribution to this community
computers have always been a passion of mine, but quite frankly, I
never saw it as path that I would take professionally. But I have deicided
to change that and pivot from where I'm right now. <br>
I look forward to jump in the deep end and develop projects with the community in the near future.
